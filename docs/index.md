## Introduction

**Mega Python** is an online ninja training school ‚öîÔ∏è for the Python Enthusiast and dedicated to the programming toddlers. Start by learning how to hold basic Python chopsticks ü•¢, then take the journey all the way to becoming a Python Zen Master üê≤.

I don't make any assumption about your prior programming knowledge and try to teach everything from scratch.

Let the force be with you!

## Audience

The resources are intended for the beginners, toddlers, hobbyist coders, dedicated but not-learnt and new programmers. It can also be used as a reference by more experienced developers.

## Motivation

As a beginner I really struggled to find the right sources for learning Python and ended up taking a lot of free and paid online courses, which finally ended up in confusion and frustration. So I decided to write a simple to understand, beginner oriented resources for learning Python.

## Code Sample

All code will be in the form of following block

```python
# python code
def hello():
    print('Hello World')
```

## About Me
