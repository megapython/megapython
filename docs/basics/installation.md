# Installation

Learn how to install Python 3 on your machine.

But, before actually installing there are some points that I would like you to note. Python actually comes pre-installed on most operating system these days, but its the old and legacy version Python 2.

Python 2 will officially be retiring on Jan 1st, 2020, so its ideal to straight away get working with Python 3. Check out the installation instructions as per your operating system.

## Installing on Windows

Installing Python 3 on Windows is just as easy as installing any other program, in addition to Python 3, I would highly recommend installing **Git Bash**, so that you can work with the exact same commands in the tutorial as mine and we need not keeping on switching between operating systems. Ofcouse, I will let you know whenever there are differences.

Navigate to following link and download the setup file

    https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Under {==Stable Releases==} check out your system and download the setup file accordingly, in most cases your system should be 64 bit, if that's the case you can download the following setup file

    Windows x86-64 executable installer

After downloading you can install it as you would install any other program. The installer will install everything and also setup environment variables.

## Installing on Mac

Navigate to following link and download the setup file

    https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

Under {==Stable Releases==} you can download the following file

    macOS 64-bit installer

And then install it as any other program, it will automatically setup environment variables for you.

**Alternatively**

If you are using brew, then installing Python is very simple, open your terminal and type

    brew install python

By default brew will install python 3 to the following directory -

    /usr/local/bin/python3

You can check it by typing the following on your terminal

    which python3

## Installing on Linux
