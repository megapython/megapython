# About

Hi, my name is {==Anil Kulkarni==} and I am passionate about coding. I am a self learned programmer and enjoy my daily dose of Python & Go. When I am not coding you can usually find me watching movies ðŸŽ¬

## Post Schedule

I would be posting updates twice a week, on Tuesday & Thursday (IST). Currently, there is no deadline for creating new articles, whatever I manage to finish will be pushed online.

## Motivation

As a beginner I really struggled to find the right sources for learning Python and ended up taking a lot of free and paid online courses, which finally ended up in confusion and frustration. So I decided to write a simple to understand, beginner oriented resources for learning Python.

## Contributing Content

The entire project is open source and available on Github, including this website which is using Github Pages. You can star, fork or even better send a pull request, all of the updates would be reviewed and merged as per the schedule.

Currently the project is using Mkdocs to generate content, but aims to use Django Framework sometime in the future.
